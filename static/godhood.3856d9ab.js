For AI, “human gods” are individuals with distinct personalities who make different choices when faced with the same events. From this, we deduce a key dimension for AI to learn from human gods: personality. </div><div class="details"> Unlike many AI projects focused on detecting human emotions, emotional analysis is a popular direction today. For instance, empathy AI measures dozens of emotional dimensions to capture a richer, more nuanced understanding of human emotions. However, such experiments are foundational and resemble teaching AI to recognize a concept it can’t fully comprehend. This is why emotional AI still lacks genuine depth. GAEA, drawing from human history and belief systems, proposes that advanced intelligent life originates in “fiction” and “belief in fiction.” To make AI understand human gods, it may need something akin to Greek mythology. </div><div class="details"> In Greek mythology, gods are endowed with vivid personalities. Their actions naturally align with their character traits. At a macro level, the gods’ wars, alliances, love, and rivalries are driven by their personalities. At a micro level, an impulsive god is more likely to display intense emotions. The gods’ perspectives on events often differ significantly, influenced not just by their status or circumstances but by their personalities. History has shown that many pivotal decisions were shaped by historical figures’ personalities. </div></div><div class="py-8 space-y-4"><div class="flex items-center space-x-8"><div class="w-[55%] space-y-5"><div class="w-full"><img src="'+Y+'" class="w-full h-full object-fill"></div></div><div class="flex-1 details"> From personality to emotion, AI can better grasp why humans experience diverse emotions.
